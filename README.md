# ImageSharpeningProject
While learning about Convolutional Neural Network and how the model differs from a traditional mlp. I saw an opportunity to create a useful webapplication using Python and Shiny web application. To allow users to upload a photo and then 
to their photo would be applied a convoluational filter with a specific kernel that will allow for the input image to become the sharpened output image.
